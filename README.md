#FX Machine: Be the master of your effects !

#Description

###Who are we ?
We are four students from an engineer school in France called Polytech Nice-Sophia.

###What is FX Machine project ?
We have developed a website for guitarists who would like to have their own effect pedals on
their computers. 

###Tired to buy or test a lot of pedal because you can't find the perfect sound?
 Don't worry, FX Machine is the solution made for you! Thanks to our system, you will be able to
create your own pedal by selecting every components (filters, effects) of your pedal.
When you finish, you can save it and share it with your friends.

### Wait we made more functionalities!
 Once you have built your pedal with all effects you need, you can save it and share it to your
friends. In fact, when you save, your pedal is public and people can use it.
